# simple-adrs
A CLI to generate simple ADRs with supersedes/superseded logic out of the box

## Getting Started
```
npm install simple-adrs --save-dev
```

To create an ADR, run 
```
npx simple-adrs
```

This will trigger the command line prompt which will guide you from there. 

## Quick Notes
This will create and ADR directory in the root of your project. Each ADR created will be it's own file, with a reference to it in the RECORD.md file. 

If you would like to change any of these things, file an issue and we can take it under consideration.
